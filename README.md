Project Description:
 
Our application aims to make the most of what remains in the pantry. First, the user is prompted to enter the ingredients he or she possesses. Our application hits the Edamam API with those inputs and brings back meals that match the search specifications. 

For users who would like more control on the meal curation process, we have an advanced search that allows users to input dietary preferences (vegetarian/vegan/gluten-free) and allergy information.

The user will also get a map of places nearby that would accept food donations in the case that the user did not want to cook or had other ingredients that were not used.  Additionally, if a user doesn't find the perfect recipe, a map of nearby restaurants (courtesy of Google Places library) is offered.
